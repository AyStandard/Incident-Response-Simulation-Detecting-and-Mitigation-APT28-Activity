### 🧾 **Overview**  
Simulated a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** investigation responding to a potential **APT28** attack targeting *E-corp*, a manufacturer of rare-earth metals.  
Using the **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator**, I identified, mapped, and mitigated the adversary’s **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** to prevent network compromise and data theft.

### 🎯 **Key Objectives**
- 🔍 Identify APT28’s reconnaissance and initial access techniques.  
- 👤 Analyze accounts potentially compromised during resource development.  
- ⚙️ Detect user execution and scripting interpreter activities.  
- 🪟 Track registry changes for persistence mechanisms.  
- 🧰 Scrutinize system binaries for proxy execution and defense evasion.  
- 🌐 Detect lateral movement via remote services.  
- 📤 Prevent exfiltration attempts to command-and-control (C2) servers.
